# Vue Prototypes
This repo is a place to build and test prototypes and fun ideas. My goal is to experiment with ideas, packages, and vue features before putting them in larger-scope projects.
  - You can view the collection and play around [HERE](https://scotts-vue.onrender.com).
  - the code for each mini-project / demo can be found in their own view or component.
  - in between the fun I'll comment my code and work on making each portion responsive :)

# List of ideas I'll be working on:
  - **Schultz Table Challenge** : based on the brain training game where you see how fast you can tap/click from lowest to highest number ( or vice versa )
  - **Tower of Hanoi Challenge** : based on another brain challenge where you move the stack of blocks from one peg to the other without placing a larger block on top of a smaller block
  - **RPG Battler** : put your character against an enemy! This will let me experiment for a larger project idea.
  - **Timer app** : Timer that allows for intervals and tasks. This is a prototype for a piece of a mobile app.
  - **Shop**: a mock online store with shopping cart and mock checkout
  
## Schultz Table Challenge
  - code found in [src/views/SchultzView.vue](https://github.com/ScottGarberJr/vue-practice/blob/master/vuePractice/src/views/SchultzView.vue)
  - *screenshots coming soon*
  - issues found:
    - not responsive
    - user cant start from largest number and go down on size 16 or 25 tables
    - if user changes size on dropdown and does not click the 'New' button, game cannot be completed.
    - going to remove the New button and just auto-new when new size selected
